Method
1. Slice paneer into 3/4 inch cubes. Keep aside.
2. Grind cashews into powder-like consistency. Keep aside.
3. Puree tomatoes, green chili and ginger. Keep aside.
4. Add oil in a pan, over medium heat. Shallow fry paneer cubes till they turn slightly brown.
Remove from pan and place over paper towels to absorb excess oil.
5. Increase heat to medium-high and test the oil by adding one cumin seed. If it cracks
immediately, the oil is ready.
6. Add cumin seeds to the oil and as they crack, add asafoetida and bay leaves. Stir for a
few seconds.
7. Add tomato puree, coriander powder, turmeric, red chili powder, and paprika. Cook the
mixture, stirring occasionally for 2-3 minutes. It will reduce to half its volume and start
separating from the oil.
8. Add sugar, cashew powder and yogurt. Cook for another minute then add 1 cup of water
and salt and bring to boil.
9. Add paneer and cover the pan. Simmer for a few minutes over medium-low heat, till gravy
is slightly thick in consistency.
10. Remove from heat, add garam masala and chopped cilantro. Mix gently, cover the pan
and let it sit for a couple of minutes.
11. Shahi paneer tastes best if it is served hot.
